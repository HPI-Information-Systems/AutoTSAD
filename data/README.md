# Datasets for AutoTSAD

This folder contains the time series used to evaluate the AutoTSAD system.
We use time series from many collections (domains).
The sources of those datasets are the [TimeEval benchmark](https://hpi-information-systems.github.io/timeeval-evaluation-paper/notebooks/Datasets.html) and the [SAND paper supporting website](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/SAND).

> Unfortunately, we are not allowed to share the time series datasets from the IOPS and WebscopeS5 collections (from the TimeEval source).
> Please ask the original publishers of the datasets to get the source datasets.

The file [`datasets.csv`](./datasets.csv) lists all datasets with their paths (relative to this folder) in machine-readable form.
